    <p>Last year I started working with Chris and George on a multi agent robot planning problem!   Our work was featured in various news outlets. 
	You can read more about it from the <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/csail-delivery-robots-collaborate-0810">MIT tech article.</a>  We also were selected as a best paper finalist at the RSS 2015 conference.  
	You can find the publication <a href="http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss11/p07.html">here</a>. 
	Last but not least, this project was a runner up in the inaugural <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/rh-competition/">CSAIL Research Highlights.</a>
