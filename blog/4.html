    <p id="intro_text">This fall I took 16.31 Feedback and Control Systems as I have decided to pursue a minor in Aero/Astro!  In the course we received a Rolling Spider Parrot drone and learned different methods to control it.  During the labs we implemented these controllers.<br></p><p>
    Our final project was open ended.  My group decided to make the drone use its onboard camera to follow a yellow line on the ground.  Unfortunately in later versions we forgot the yellow tape and had to make use of the more common electrical tape.<br></p><p>
    The code for our project is available online at <a href="https://github.com/arii/FollowTheYellowBrickRoad">github.</a></p>
