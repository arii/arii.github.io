        I am a roboticist with almost a decade of experience blending the fields of robotics and computer science. Currently, I am working at an early stage robotics startup, <a href="https://robust.ai">robust.ai</a>.</p>
        <p>
            
            I completed my PhD at MIT where I researched robust robotic manipulation methods with the vision of enabling household helpers. As a teaching assistant at MIT, I taught three undergraduate hands-on robotics laboratory courses and instructed two high-school autonomous vehicle classes. As a PhD candidate, I also lectured a mechanical engineering course on Dynamics at Olin College of Engineering. My passions extend outside research and education: at MIT I helped found a clean energy assessment center, developed an iOS app for people with vision impairment, and received a grant to install therapy lamps across campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            I attained a BS in Computer Engineering from the University of California: Santa Cruz in 2012. I earned a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2014 and completed my PhD in 2019.
