            Ariel Anders is a roboticist with almost a decade of experience blending the fields of robotics and computer science. Ariel is a PhD candidate at MIT researching robust robotic manipulation methods with the vision of enabling household helpers. As a teaching assistant at MIT she has taught three undergraduate hands-on robotics laboratory courses and instructed two high-school autonomous vehicle classes. Most recently, she lectured a mechanical engineering course on Dynamics at Olin College of Engineering. Her passions extend outside research and education: at MIT she helped found a clean energy assessment center, developed an iOS app for people with vision impairment, and received a grant to install therapy lamps across campus.
