    <p id="intro_text"> The PR2 is an awesome robot!  It's also pretty safe to use around people, which is why our group has frequent requests for lab tours.  These are great opportunities to promote robots and computer science! In the past, I have given robot demonstrations to K-12 students and once for Make a Wish.  Typically, I give a demo using the Interactive Manipulation software only. </p>  
    <p>Last week I gave a course to my fellow lab members on how to give robot demos.  The course was not intended to teach people how to program the robot, in fact it gives instructions assuming the user has no command line experience.  See the <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/pr2/wiki/index.php?title=Robot_Demo_Instructions">wiki page</a> for more information.</p>
