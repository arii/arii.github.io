    Einstein, Newton and Pascal decide to play hide and	 seek. Einstein is it. He closes his eyes, counts to 10 then opens	 them. Pascal is nowhere to be seen. Newton is sitting right in front of Einstein, with a piece of chalk in his hand. He's sitting in a box drawn on the ground, a meter to a side. Einstein says Newton, you're terrible, I've found you! Newton says "No no, Einstein. You've found one Newton per square meter. You've found Pascal!"

The constant answers "That's a differential operator. If it acts on me, I disappear." e^x says "I'm e^x, I don't have anything to worry about." and keeps on walking. When he reaches the differential operator, he says "Hi, I'm e^x."
