Dear awesome Robotics Company, \\
\\\par
I am an Electrical Engineering Computer Science doctorate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology seeking a robotics internship.  I am interested in pursuing areas that center around my research focus of robotic planning and manipulation. \par 
At MIT, I have investigated different facets of robotic planning and manipulation. My masterâ€™s thesis investigated applying reinforcement learning to robotic grasping.  More recently I collaborated on a multi robot planning project that was applied to several domains, including a beer delivery one.  This project, titled ``Beer Bots'' won second place at the inaugural CSAIL Research Highlights. Additionally the paper we presented for this project was a best paper finalist at RSS 2015.   \par 

My current focus is improving  humanoid robots manipulation capability.  I'm taking inspiration from large manufacturing  systems, such as the vibratory bowl feeder, which uses orientating devices to force items into a specific range of configurations.  This idea, applied in a robot domain is fundamentally different from current approaches and could yield more predictable results. Ultimately, my goal for this research is for the robot to solve long sequential manipulation problems for useful tasks like assembly or household cleaning.

Sincerely,\\ \par
Ariel Anders

%I'm a roboticist with experience in  planning under uncertainty, robotic manipulation, autonomous vehicles, multi-robot planning, and dental robotic surgery. I have competed and placed in 4 tech competitions and have a 4+ star app on the iOS store to help blind people detect different levels of light. I'm currently working on making a lab on campus more energy efficient and spearheaded a project to install artificial lightboxes on campus to ameliorate effects of Seasonal Affection Disorder. I'm passionate about teaching and have years of experience instructing high-school through college age students.
